# MR-compatible-clips
STL files for 3D printing MR-compatible clips for a Siemens scanner.

These clips are for cable management for MR-compatible peripherals such as a response device (button box) or headphones. They also help to keep the plastic tubing for the alert squeezebulb from getting tangled or caught and pinched. I have only tested these with our scanner (a Cima.X), but they should be compatible with any Siemens scanner with a 10.5mm slot. These slide in from the opening at the end of the scanner bed. 
## The final product: rounded clip

**Caveat emptor:** These are distributed with no guaruntee of functionality. You're welcome to download and modify to suit your own needs. My hope is that these will help protect your subjects from potential coil loops and possible burns and that they'll extend the life of your very expensive MR-compatible peripheral equipment, but of course I make no guarantees.
